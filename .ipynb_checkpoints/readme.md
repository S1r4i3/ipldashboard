The algorithm used in this code is likely a classification model trained using machine learning. The function model.predict_proba(input_df) suggests that the model outputs probabilities for two classes (win or loss). Typically, this kind of probability prediction is associated with algorithms like:

Logistic Regression – Commonly used for binary classification, predicting probabilities for two outcomes.
Random Forest – Can be used for classification and provides probability estimates.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) – These are popular for classification tasks and often used in competitions like predicting match outcomes.
The specific algorithm would depend on how the model was trained and saved as a pickle file (model.pkl).










Pickle is a Python library used for serializing and deserializing Python objects, meaning it allows you to save a Python object (e.g., a machine learning model, dictionary, list) into a file and load it back when needed. Here’s how it's useful:

Saving Machine Learning Models: Once you've trained a model, you can save it using Pickle (pkl.dump) and load it later (pkl.load) to make predictions without needing to retrain the model.

Efficient Data Storage: Pickle can store complex Python objects (like dictionaries, lists, or even custom classes) in binary format, making it easier to retrieve and use later.

Portability: It allows sharing of trained models and data between different environments, enabling reproducibility and collaboration.

In your code, Pickle is used to load the teams, cities, and the pre-trained model (team.pkl, city.pkl, model.pkl), enabling quick access to these resources without needing to redefine them.
